The code and the datasets I used for this analysis can be download from https://github.com/HascoetGwenole/CS7641-Assignment3

This github repository contains a jupyter notebook for both datasets I chose for this assigment (respectively named 
"Unsupervised Learning Digit Dataset.ipynb" and "Unsupervised Learning Phishing website.ipynb"). This github repositoty 
also contains the phishing website dataset  called "dataset.csv". ( The digit dataset is the one avialable in the
Sklearn library, so it is loaded directly in the notebook).

To be run, both notebooks can be opened with Jupyter Notebook, and then each cell can be run individualy.
For "Unsupervised Learning Phishing website.ipynb", one must change the path of dataset.csv (the variable file) so that
it point toward the destination of the file "dataset.csv" on your environment.
For the digit dataset, the dataset is load automatically from the sklearn library.
